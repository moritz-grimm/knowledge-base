# SMART Model

## Overview

The SMART model is used in agile development to precisely define goals, user stories, or sprint goals and thus bridge the gap between strategic vision and the final operational implementation.

## Criteria

### S - Specific

A goal must be clearly and precisely defined. Vague or broadly formulated goals leave too much room for interpretation and make it difficult for the team to know what exactly needs to be achieved.

### M - Measurable

Progress and completion of a goal must be measurable. Concrete metrics or acceptance criteria allow the team to objectively determine whether the goal has been reached.

### A - Attractive

A goal should be motivating and relevant to those responsible for achieving it. If the team does not see value in a goal, commitment and engagement will suffer.

### R - Realistic

A goal must be achievable with the available resources, skills, and time. Unrealistic goals demotivate the team and set the project up for failure from the start.

### T - Time-bound

Every goal needs a clear deadline or time frame. Without a defined end point, goals tend to be postponed indefinitely and lose their urgency.
