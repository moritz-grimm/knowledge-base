# INVEST Model

## Overview

INVEST is an acronym used to evaluate the quality of user stories in agile development. A well-written user story should satisfy all six criteria.

## Criteria

### I – Independent

User stories should be self-contained and not depend on other stories. This allows teams to prioritize and implement them in any order without external blockers.

### N – Negotiable

Stories are not rigid contracts. The details should remain open to discussion between the team and stakeholders until the story is committed to a sprint.

### V – Valuable

Every story must deliver clear value to the end user or the business. If a story does not provide a tangible benefit, it should be reconsidered or removed.

### E – Estimable

The team must be able to estimate the effort required to implement the story. Stories that cannot be estimated are usually too vague, too large.

### S – Small

Stories should be small enough to be completed within a single sprint. Large stories (epics) must be broken down into smaller, manageable pieces before implementation.

### T – Testable

A story must have clear acceptance criteria that allow the team to verify whether the implementation is correct and complete.

| Letter | Criterion                      | Key Question                                   |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| I      | [Independent](#i--independent) | Can this be implemented without other stories? |
| N      | [Negotiable](#n--negotiable)   | Is it debatable until it can be implemented?   |
| V      | [Valuable](#v--valuable)       | Does this deliver value to the user?           |
| E      | [Estimable](#e--estimable)     | Can we estimate the effort to implement this?  |
| S      | [Small](#s--small)             | Can this be completed within one sprint?       |
| T      | [Testable](#t--testable)       | Do we have clear acceptance criteria?          |
