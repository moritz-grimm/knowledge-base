# Gantt Chart

## Overview

A Gantt chart is a horizontal bar chart that visualizes a project schedule over time. It is one of the most widely used tools for communicating project timelines to teams and stakeholders.

## Structure

- **Rows**: individual tasks or work packages
- **Columns**: time scale (days, weeks, months)
- **Bars**: duration of each task; positioned according to start and end dates
- **Dependencies**: arrows or overlaps can indicate task dependencies

## Advantages

- Easy to read and communicate to stakeholders at any level
- Provides a clear overview of the overall project timeline
- Shows which tasks run in parallel and which are sequential
- Simple to create and maintain for small to medium projects

## Disadvantages

- Does not explicitly model task dependencies or logical relationships
- Does not identify the critical path
- Can become unwieldy for large projects with many tasks
- Changes to one task require manual adjustment of dependent tasks
