# Requirement/Functional Specifications

## Overview

In project management, the **requirement specification** and the **functional specification** are two key documents that define what a system should do and how it will be implemented.

- The **requirement specification** is written by the client and describes **what** is needed
- The **functional specification** is written by the contractor and describes **how** the requirements will be fulfilled

## Requirement Specification

Contains the requirements of a client to a contractor and a rough idea of the desired system.

- Description of the project goals
- Description of the current situation
- Safety-related requirements
- Functional requirements (What should the system do?)
- Non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, security, availability, usability)
- Time frame
- Budget

## Functional Specification

Derived from the requirement specification. It is the contractor's response describing how the requirements will be implemented.

- Technical concept (architecture, technologies)
  - Detailed description of the system components
  - Interface definitions
  - Data models
- Test criteria and acceptance conditions
- Project schedule and milestones
- Cost estimation
