# Project Phases

## Overview

The 5 project phases provide a structured framework that helps teams plan, execute, and complete a project in an organized manner. Each phase builds on the results of the previous one.

The phases slightly vary depending on whether the project is a one-time endeavor with a clear end date or a product that is actively developed further while already being used in production.

## Phases

### 1. Initialization / Analysis

In the initialization phase the project idea is evaluated and its feasibility is assessed. The goal is to determine whether the project is worth pursuing before committing significant resources.

- Define the project goals and expected outcomes
- Conduct a feasibility study
- Identify key stakeholders
- Perform an initial risk assessment
- Create a rough cost-benefit analysis

The phase typically concludes with a project charter or a go/no-go decision.

### 2. Planning

In the planning phase the team creates a detailed roadmap for how the project will be carried out. This is the most important phase for preventing problems later on.

- Define the project scope and deliverables
- Create a work breakdown structure (WBS)
- Estimate time, costs, and resources
- Build a schedule (e.g. using a Gantt chart<!-- (./gantt.md) --> or network plan<!--(./network-plan.md)-->)
- Define milestones and quality criteria
- Plan risk mitigation strategies
- Assign roles and responsibilities

### 3. Implementation / Execution

In the implementation phase the actual work is carried out according to the plan. The project manager coordinates the team and ensures that the project stays on track.

- Execute the tasks defined in the project plan
- Coordinate team members and external partners
- Communicate progress to stakeholders
- Manage changes through a change control process
- Document decisions and deviations from the plan

### 4. Testing / Monitoring

The testing and monitoring phase often runs in parallel with the [implementation phase](#3-implementation--execution). Its purpose is to ensure that the deliverables meet the defined quality criteria.

- Verify deliverables against acceptance criteria
- Track progress using key metrics (budget, timeline, scope)
- Identify and address deviations early
- Conduct quality assurance and testing
- Report status to stakeholders at regular intervals

### 5. Completion / Operation

The final phase depends on the type of project:

**One-time projects** end with a formal closure:

- Hand over deliverables to the client or end user
- Obtain formal acceptance and sign-off
- Document lessons learned for future projects
- Archive project documentation
- Release resources and close contracts

**Ongoing products** transition into an operation phase:

- Deploy the product to production
- Hand over to an operations or support team
- Establish monitoring and maintenance processes
- Plan future iterations and improvements
