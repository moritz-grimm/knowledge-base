# Electrical Units – Power, Voltage, and Current

## The Three Core Units

| Symbol | Quantity | Unit       |
| ------ | -------- | ---------- |
| P      | Power    | Watt (W)   |
| U      | Voltage  | Volt (V)   |
| I      | Current  | Ampere (A) |

## The Power Triangle

The three quantities are related by the formula **P = U x I**. Covering the quantity you want to calculate reveals the formula:

```text
      P
    -----
    U | I
```

- **P = U x I** (Power = Voltage x Current)
- **U = P / I** (Voltage = Power / Current)
- **I = P / U** (Current = Power / Voltage)

## Ohm's Law

Ohm's Law introduces resistance **R** (measured in Ohms, Ω) and connects it to voltage and current:

- **U = R x I**
- **R = U / I**
- **I = U / R**

## Combined Formulas

Combining the power formula with Ohm's Law gives additional ways to calculate power:

- **P = U² / R**
- **P = I² x R**

## Examples

**Example 1:** A device runs at 230 V and draws 2 A. What is its power consumption (P)?

```text
P = U x I = 230 V x 2 A = 460 W
```

**Example 2:** A 100 W bulb operates at 230 V. How much current (I) does it draw?

```text
I = P / U = 100 W / 230 V ≈ 0.43 A
```

**Example 3:** A resistor of 50 Ω carries 3 A. What voltage drops across it?

```text
U = R x I = 50 Ω x 3 A = 150 V
```
