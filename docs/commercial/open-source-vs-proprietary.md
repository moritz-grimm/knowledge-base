# Open Source vs. Proprietary Software

## Definitions

**Open Source Software**: The source code is publicly available. Anyone can inspect, modify, and distribute the software, subject to the terms of its license (e.g. MIT, GPL, Apache).

**Proprietary Software**: The source code is kept private by the vendor. Usage is governed by a license agreement and modification and redistribution are typically prohibited.

## Open Source

### Advantages

- **Free to use**: In most cases, free to use without license fees
- **Transparency**: the code can be audited for security vulnerabilities and bugs
- **Community-driven**: Can be further developed by the community without being completely dependent on the original developer
- **Flexibility**: Can be customized by an individual to suit their individual needs

### Disadvantages

- **Support**: Community support may be unreliable, in the case of small communities, non-existent or require additional payment
- **Usability**: often less polished interfaces compared to commercial alternatives
- **Security risk**: publicly visible code can also be analyzed by attackers
- **Licensing complexity**: different open source licenses may impose restrictions (e.g. copyleft)
- **Maintenance burden**: self-hosting requires internal expertise and time

### Examples

- Firefox
- Linux
- React
- VSCode

## Proprietary Software

### Advantages

- **Professional support**: dedicated vendor support with SLAs
- **Polish and UX**: typically higher investment in user experience and documentation
- **Reliable updates & maintenance**: Regularly tested updates & patches are provided by the provider without the need for in-house expertise to perform updates.
- **Integration**: Often comes with good compatibility with other software from the same manufacturer

### Disadvantages

- **Cost**: licensing fees can be significant, especially at scale
- **Vendor lock-in**: dependency on the vendor's roadmap and pricing
- **No transparency**: cannot audit the source code for security or quality
- **Restrictions**: limited ability to customize or extend beyond what the vendor allows

## Examples

- Microsoft Office
- Windows, iOS, MacOS
- Discord
- Google Chrome
