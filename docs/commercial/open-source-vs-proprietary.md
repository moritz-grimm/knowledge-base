# Open Source vs. Proprietary Software

## Definitions

**Open Source Software**: The source code is publicly available. Anyone can inspect, modify, and distribute the software, subject to the terms of its license (e.g. MIT, GPL, Apache).

**Proprietary Software**: The source code is kept private by the vendor. Usage is governed by a license agreement; modification and redistribution are typically prohibited.

## Open Source

### Advantages

- **Free to use** in most cases (no licensing fees)
- **Transparency**: the code can be audited for security vulnerabilities and bugs
- **Community-driven**: large communities contribute fixes and improvements
- **No vendor lock-in**: the software can be forked if development stalls
- **Flexibility**: can be adapted to specific needs

### Disadvantages

- **Support**: community support may be unreliable; paid support requires additional cost
- **Usability**: often less polished interfaces compared to commercial alternatives
- **Security risk**: publicly visible code can also be analyzed by attackers
- **Licensing complexity**: different open source licenses may impose restrictions (e.g. copyleft)
- **Maintenance burden**: self-hosting requires internal expertise

## Proprietary Software

### Advantages

- **Professional support**: dedicated vendor support with SLAs
- **Polish and UX**: typically higher investment in user experience and documentation
- **Accountability**: clear vendor responsible for bugs and updates
- **Integration**: often comes with certified integrations and compatibility guarantees

### Disadvantages

- **Cost**: licensing fees can be significant, especially at scale
- **Vendor lock-in**: dependency on the vendor's roadmap, pricing, and availability
- **No transparency**: cannot audit the source code for security or quality
- **Restrictions**: limited ability to customize or extend beyond what the vendor allows
