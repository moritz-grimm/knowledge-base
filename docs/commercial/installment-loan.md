# Installment Loan

## What is an installment loan?

An installment loan is a type of loan that is repaid over time with a set number of scheduled payments. Unlike revolving credit (e.g., credit cards), the loan is fully repaid at the end of the term.

This example demonstrates a **fixed principal repayment** model, where the borrower pays off the same amount of the loan each year, while interest decreases over time.

## Formula

```text
Annual Interest = Remaining Debt * Interest Rate  

Principal Repayment = Total Debt / Loan Term  

Annuity (Annual Payment) = Interest + Principal Repayment  

Remaining Debt = Previous Debt − Principal Repayment
```

## Example

Assuming a loan of **€100,000** with an interest rate of **5%** and a fixed annual principal repayment of **€25,000** over **4 years**:

| Year | Remaining Debt | Interest (5%) | Principal Repayment | Annual Payment | Debt After Payment |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1    | €100,000       | €5,000        | €25,000             | €30,000        | €75,000            |
| 2    | €75,000        | €3,750        | €25,000             | €28,750        | €50,000            |
| 3    | €50,000        | €2,500        | €25,000             | €27,500        | €25,000            |
| 4    | €25,000        | €1,250        | €25,000             | €26,250        | €0                 |

**Total Interest Paid:** €12,500  
**Total Repaid:** €112,500
