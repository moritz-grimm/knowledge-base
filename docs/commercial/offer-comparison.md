# Offer Comparison

## Overview

An offer comparison is used in procurement to evaluate two or more supplier offers in order to determine the best deal. The process involves both a **quantitative** (measurable, cost-based) and a **qualitative** (criteria-based) comparison.

## Quantitative Comparison

The quantitative comparison focuses on measurable financial factors:

- **Purchase price / Price per unit**: The base cost of the product or service
- **Shipping and handling costs**: Additional costs for delivery and handling
- **Discount**: Applied to the list price, typically based on order volume or the business relationship
- **Cash discount (Skonto)**: A second discount granted for early payment within a specified period
- **Payment terms**: Due dates and conditions that affect the total cost

## Qualitative Comparison

The qualitative comparison evaluates non-financial criteria that are harder to quantify but equally important:

- **Quality**: Product or service quality, certifications, and standards compliance
- **Reliability**: Supplier dependability and on-time delivery history
- **Support**: After-sales service, warranty conditions, and responsiveness
- **Sustainability**: Environmental standards, regional sourcing, and ethical practices
- **Business relationship**: Existing partnerships, trust, and long-term potential

## Scoring Method

When qualitative and quantitative factors must be combined into a single decision, a **weighted scoring model** can help:

1. Define all relevant criteria and assign a weight to each (weights must sum to 100%)
2. Score each supplier on every criterion (e.g., on a scale of 1–10)
3. Multiply each score by its weight to get the weighted score
4. Sum the weighted scores per supplier
5. The supplier with the highest total score represents the best overall offer

This approach makes subjective criteria more transparent and comparable across suppliers.
